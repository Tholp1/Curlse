# Curlse

Download CurseForge modpacks using CLI.

This is a terrible tool, but it does get the job done. You need to download the manifest zip file from the website and use the curlse on it.

# Planned Features
* MULTI-THREADING
* grab pack icon from curseforge
* Direct downloading from curseforge
* Updating packs
* possibly a custom manifest format for packs with mods splt across hosts?
