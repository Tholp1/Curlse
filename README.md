# Curlse

Download CurseForge modpacks to MultiMC instances using CLI.
This is a terrible terrible tool as I mostly made it for myself, but it does get the job done. You need to download the manifest zip file from the website and use the curlse on it.

Future development from myself is unlikely, if you'd like to make a pull request I'd be happy to atleast look at it.

while i would rather use GPL3, im using MPL2 to be on the same side, even though this shares no code with it, I use Feriums api key to save some headache
